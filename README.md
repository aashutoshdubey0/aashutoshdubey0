### Hi there 👋
Welcome to my CodeCrush where I showcase my talents as a HackHound and a RepoRanger. I am currently in my pre-final year at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology pursuing Computer Engineering. I have developed a keen interest in Data Science. Especially in fields of NLP, Time Series, Prediction Models and Computer Vision. I am still building my portfolio and hope to add tons of projects soon. Thank you for visiting my GITHUB! :)
